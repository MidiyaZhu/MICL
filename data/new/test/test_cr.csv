they 're easy to use,1,0
"playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options",1,1
"simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point",1,2
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone,1,3
"oh , and another is the cool halo light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer",1,4
i 'd say that this camera is perfect,1,5
this is the best phone i have seen,1,6
this one has a good looking,1,7
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self timer,1,8
don 't care about sunlight it 's tft,1,9
"other than that , i love this camera",1,10
"the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject",1,11
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone,1,12
"the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long",1,13
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad,1,14
the camera was a marvel,1,15
the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does,1,16
"these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable",1,17
"the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re entering my numbers",1,18

"the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does !",1,20
what impressed me most was the sound,1,21
"could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) purple fringing , details in high light area , noise over iso100 , red eyes , ( few ) processing artefact 's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight",1,22
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly,1,23
"yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range",1,24
it 's easy,1,25
very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures,1,26
8 battery life is excellent,1,27
"everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more",1,28
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important,1,29
c i do love audio sync which allows a one click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer,1,30
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime,1,31
it holds plenty of songs,1,32
"the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus",1,33
"still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features !",1,34
there is an open source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features,1,35
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone,1,36
"i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far",1,37
"the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player )",1,38
interface practically seamless,1,39
the player is great,1,40
"overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it",1,41
what i like the most small and solid feel,1,42
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player,1,43
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? i have to check again ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date,1,44
"this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want",1,45
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker,1,46
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product,1,47
"without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image !",1,48
"the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality",1,49
"i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps directions into it , which is great",1,50
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high end player,1,51
but you can download some really good ones like pac man or mafia wars,1,52
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price,1,53
"you can also slow a song down speed it up , which is cool too",1,54
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully,1,55
the sound quality is also nice after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with,1,56
"i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones",1,57
i would put the hitachi up with the best !,1,58
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable,1,59
"my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared",1,60
"two it has a removeable rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re !",1,61
it works with a minimum of fuss,1,62
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out,1,63
"pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too",1,64
1 ) great audio quality overall,1,65
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera,1,66

"the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones )",1,68
great price,1,69
"overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity",1,70
so far i have no complaints with this player,1,71
"it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too",1,72
i am very pleased with it so far,1,73
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad,1,74
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package,1,75
"if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else",1,76
"this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product",1,77
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again,1,78
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance,1,79
"the installation , set up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well",1,80
usb 2 0 very fast,1,81
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v,1,82
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing,1,83
"the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery",1,84
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into what diaper smell in less time than that,1,85
and the slim form factor together with the mirror like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey !,1,86
"built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig",1,87
i think it 's great,1,88
"i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it it 's size",1,89
"the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy",1,90
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible,1,91
"there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc",1,92
"by the way , it looks nice also",1,93
outside of the t mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at t wireless and various other services where the t mobile service was unavailable,1,94
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing,1,95
"not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have",1,96
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ),1,97
"overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it",1,98

it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours ),1,111

the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly,1,113

the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick,1,115
i highly recommend this phone,1,116
"it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid",1,117
i went out and got the canon today,1,118
best in class sound,1,119
4 the build is just right,1,120
"while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability",1,121
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary,1,122
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever,1,123
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle,1,124
"it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish",1,125
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough,1,126
the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep,1,127
"all in all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use",1,128
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device,1,129
"it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range",1,130

the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year,1,132
"the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead",1,133
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since,1,134
the image quality is excellent,1,135
"with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots",1,136
"it 's easy to use not too small , and not too big",1,137
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had,1,138
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright,1,139
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use,1,140
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options,1,141
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use,1,142
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ),1,143
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients,1,144
i must have gotten a good one,1,145
"the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy",1,146
best electronic i 've bought since i was born,1,147
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated,1,148
i never had a single problem,1,149
"there 's even an equalizer ( under settings ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , deep , and electronic",1,150
"the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly",1,151
"yes , the 1 800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem",1,152
"i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else",1,153
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s,1,154

it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general to moderate snapping,1,157
"battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have",1,158
the camera res ponce is very quick,1,159
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did,1,160
we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like 6 00 and they work great,1,161
it has many great features and very few bad ones,1,162
i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it,1,163
"if compact size is your highest priority in a 2 megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design",1,164
i have the black one and adore it,1,165
"the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great",1,166
"as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better",1,167
"playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists",1,168
"the auto focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes they are dummy proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera",1,169
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty 500 price tag and get a quality camera,1,170
this phone has a very cool and useful feature the speakerphone,1,171
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks,1,172
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use,1,173
"i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy",1,174
"it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well",1,175
incredible memory !,1,176
"the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate",1,177
"the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable )",1,178
3 ) user replaceable battery,1,179
great screen and great sound,1,180
"just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time",1,181
"this is a benefit for many reasons one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket",1,182
"oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet",1,183
"for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better",1,184
great camera,1,185
"reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm",1,186
"second , the automatic sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer",1,187
"transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy",1,188
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder,1,189
camera is a paper weight,1,190
"so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all",1,191
"i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear",1,192
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with,1,193
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company,1,194
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi pro pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography,1,195
i love the bluetooth easy to use with a wireless abra headset,1,196
i really love this phone,1,197
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it,1,198
"nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try jog with it or something",1,199
in addition it is very easy to setup,1,200
"the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun",1,201
the included software removes any red eye easily,1,202
saw the hitachi on amazon com with their 25 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out,1,203
"in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great !",1,204
"there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box",1,205
it is the most bang for the buck out there,1,206
6600 looks and feels nice,1,207
even viewed cds full of jogs,1,208
"i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit",1,209
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority,1,210
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some,1,211
a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality,1,212
"this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine",1,213
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini,1,214
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog,1,215
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots,1,216
the battery has a long life,1,217
amazon is awesome !,1,218
b fast mediasource cd ripping takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive,1,219
great video clip quality for a digital camera so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? ) the 2 0 megapixel one ),1,220
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar,1,221
"when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental",1,222
"the in program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well",1,223
"among my requirements for a phone were good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support",1,224
"best phone i 've ever owned , period",1,225
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera,1,226
"it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager i e organizer ) , and the radio !",1,227
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well,1,228
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players,1,229
") the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors",1,230
"it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot",1,231
apex ad 2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd r rw and dvd r rw ( unlike sony or panasonic one supports only r rw and another supports r rw ),1,232
"i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho )",1,233
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone,1,234
"5 ) the cheap , user replaceable battery ( 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs 100 to replace",1,235
"i don 't believe this camera is still available but if you can find one , you might like to get it",1,236
3 it never smelled at all,1,237
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk,1,238
"compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck",1,239
"essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless",0,240
the entire unit was poorly crafted,0,241
"as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance",0,242
"i 've tried the belkin fm transmitter unit with it it worked well when i set it on top of a portable radio , but was awful trying to use in the car which is somewhat of a disappointment",0,243
"unlike my 3 other mp3 players , this thing will only work properly if you have id3 tags on all of your tracks",0,244
i then realized a major design flaw,0,245
but this is not documented in the zen manual neither the hard copy nor the cd version,0,246
the vibrate setting is loud !,0,247
i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable,0,248
imagine my shock and absolute instant disdain for any products made by apex,0,249
"i forgot , the case does n 't fit",0,250
"the first one we installed did n 't work , and our kids were devastated to say the least",0,251
"a ) feel cheap the plastic is feels like it would break very easily , and it definately wouldnt survive a drop",0,252
"it is some protection for the unit , but for use ability , forget it",0,253
"after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window",0,254
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files just subscription wma files,0,255
the 2nd dvd player had a faulty power supply which caused to occasionally not turn on,0,256
player has a problem with dual layer dvd 's such as alias season 1 and season 2,0,257
cons no am fm radio tuner something a large number of compete tors are doing,0,258
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem,0,259
1 your hitachi might come to you with a stiff spring mechanism,0,260
"again , this is a design flaw in the headphone !",0,261
what a disappointment !,0,262
it seems to be a little slow when identifying a new disc that 's inserted maybe 10 seconds of wait,0,263
"4 the zen stores data files , but does not allow a folder structure nor does it allow documents to be opened or programs to be launched from its disk ( they must be copied to another hard drive to be launched )",0,264
"i did n 't abuse it , i charged it every day , but the headphone jack just sort of fizzled out",0,265
"when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry !",0,266
"after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up",0,267
crappy headphones,0,268
yes the included earphones suck but everyone replaces them anyway,0,269
"next , the big reason not to buy any norton product if there 's a problem with it , norton charges 30 to even tell them about it",0,270
"first , it serious , serious installation problems",0,271
"i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud",0,272
"i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download",0,273
"unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually",0,274
i did not managed to make creative nomad explorer to work,0,275
they obviously have quality and reliability problems,0,276
"this isn 't uncommon in cameras , though , just as long as you bring your charger and spare batteries , you should be fine",0,277
do not buy any home version of norton anything,0,278
"they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping 15 to handle and ship a cd ? and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails",0,279
"like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error it was not",0,280
1 ) fragile ( i broke the 1st one within 10 days ),0,281
"the canon software for raw images does not present you with a raw image at all , but the raw image after it has been processed by all the image affecting settings in the camera",0,282
"in any case , navigation by artist album is ok however i miss an ability to navigate by folders",0,283
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient,0,284
1 ) the included lens cap is very loose on the camera,0,285
"i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason to keep the zen micro charged",0,286
"otherwise , it is difficult to figure out and awkward",0,287
"the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10 or so",0,288
i would have rated it five stars but for the poor manual,0,289
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks,0,290
even with newborn diapers it filled way too fast,0,291
t mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate,0,292
"headphones suck , i would invest in some cool ones since it has the eax feature",0,293
the interface used could be better designed,0,294
however the main reason i am not satisfied with this product is the fact that it will lock up at odd times,0,295
"after hooking the thing up , i found that it would only played less than 50 of the dvds i put in it",0,296
"in addition , i don 't believe that it is odorless",0,297
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it,0,298
"remote buttons are small and closely spaced , especially with the menu buttons",0,299

the buttons are rather stiff,0,302
no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking,0,303
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds,0,304

"third , the poor design continues with the case",0,319
"weaknesses are minor the feel and layout of the remote control are only so so it does n 't show the complete file names of mp3s with really long names you must cycle through every zoom setting ( 2x , 3x , 4x , 1 2x , etc ) before getting back to normal size sorry if i 'm just ignorant of a way to get back to 1x quickly",0,320
4 ) no fm or voice recording these would have been nice extras,0,321
a bit disappoint on that !,0,322
looks and durability i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface,0,323

"respectable , solid , but not awe inspiring",0,338

"there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs 20 more",0,349

"both of the problem dvd 's would repeatedly freeze during playback , while the counter on the player kept going",0,368
"my other gripe is the incredibly crappy remote , which is worse than other , cheaper apex units",0,369

images taken indoor were n 't so clear,0,371
"i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked",0,372
