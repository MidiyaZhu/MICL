"itunes this is a love hate relationship program usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod",1,2775
nokia and t mobile really teamed up well on this baby,1,2262
"so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren ' t really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own",1,1722
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first class digital camera at a reasonable price there is no better camera out there period !,1,1146
"we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome",1,3088
it definitely keeps the smell out,1,734
upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player,1,2942
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ),1,402
"if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you",1,2879
"all in all , this is another excellent creative product",1,2466
"i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product !",1,1580
"i can ' t smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby )",1,2610
"the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit ' s size in doing so",1,2559
"8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes )",1,3113

"12 ) big storage my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) !",1,1974
"it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor !",1,130

"3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff",1,1964
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ),1,2900
"the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven ' t had any problems with it",1,240
"it ' s not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video",1,2671
no matter the format,1,2562
"this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift",1,268
"by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch",1,3332
"on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured",1,3175
"the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to",1,3295
have a great and easy to use bundled software,1,3294
"but since it ' s so small , it isn ' t a big deal to bring it with me",1,2354
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry,1,1256
there are number of downloads needed available for this phone they will be text ed to you at no cost,1,3093
"in conclusion , this player is beautiful",1,3267
"although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do to be a wireless telephone",1,2871
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all,1,3154
"transfer through windows explorer windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad",1,2897
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions,1,1366
"battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so",1,2603
"when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i ' d happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you ' ve got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage",1,682
"as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast about one or two seconds per song",1,806
this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks,1,1632
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book !,1,2723
flawless,1,338
"the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close",1,2470
excellent sound i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox,1,2362
"very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you ' re going to get at this price",1,400
"update i knew that i loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend ' s house really reinforced that !",1,3012
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e !,1,112
"it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing !",1,330
"10 ) multiple play modes tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter",1,1812
i gave the zen 5 stars because it ' s excellent for the class that it is in and it ' s not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class,1,2615
i ' ve had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures,1,516
"overall , i ' m giving this 5 stars as i ' ve seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i ' ve only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too",1,2314
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone unlike the nokia 3650 and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make,1,2776
it also holds a lot more diapers,1,2909
the supplied headphones are hands down better than the mediocre ipod buds,1,1196
"the rate plans are also very good , at least for me",1,1840
"like it ' s predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business )",1,2018
"these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can ' t be without one",1,2543
i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 8 gb free,1,1886
very cool features great camera with zoom cool quality pictures great ringtones bluetooth feature is great,1,1300
"nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop",1,1452
"i like the nomad ' s color better , but it ' s not terribly flashy",1,3005
") one outstanding positive feature is the battery it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup",1,2526
5 the price is right,1,3017
"one it ' s size it ' s smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini ' s 4gbs )",1,1178
"to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod",1,1680
i find it pretty easy to use and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ),1,3146
6 small but very clear tft screen,1,670
"despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc",1,1786
"songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time",1,1164
the service from t mobile is very good too,1,1110
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and or groups is really cool,1,608
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides,1,3045
this thing plays everything i feed it,1,2430
"the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones",1,222
nokia does not disappoint in this model,1,778
"overall , this product is awesome",1,2358
"creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie",1,2651
each battery lasts about 10 11 hours,1,2650
"the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise",1,906
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter ' s nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers,1,2960
this phone is one of the best i ' ve ever used,1,34
"great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! ! !",1,1980
"pros huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery",1,2234
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility,1,3269
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around,1,1230
just point and shoot and the photos were great,1,2218
overall i like it,1,1466
"comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small",1,1016
"also , very light and portable",1,2978
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router,1,1698
"while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys",1,1656
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities,1,1910
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require !,1,3243
so far the software for the pc works easily,1,2616
"if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don ' t need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you !",1,1650
camera quality isn ' t bad for the low resolution,1,3238
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn ' t budge even at the gym,1,2186
"you can create playlists , drag drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player",1,1708
"the good 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution",1,3126
seriously ! i love it !,1,2898
its not a perfect system but its a very good one,1,658
"the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use",1,740
it is an extremely cool cozmo,1,2945
"you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed",1,2637
"ease of use design the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can ' t figure this out , you shouldn ' t even own one",1,3055
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost,1,1308
"while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price about 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player",1,2512
"it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx",1,1762
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue lit trimming is an added bonus,1,842
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package,1,1604
"the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that ' s where my thumb is when i hold the thing !",1,1138
"original review december 2004 i ' m sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great !",1,1406
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle,1,2584
the look feel i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance,1,2790
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved,1,1338
love the speaker phone,1,214
"ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine this little camera has so many features i have n ' t even gotten to all of them yet",1,2731
it ' s great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen,1,482
"likewise , i ' ve heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too",1,3204
i ' ve had it for about a week now and have to say it ' s one of the best purchases i ' ve ever made,1,2434
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you ' ll use all the time,1,1438
"but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful it ' s a built in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying",1,2690
i am really impressed by this dvd player,1,3224
"both are very easy to learn use , and intuitive enough for even a novice",1,252
1 it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills,1,150
"the 6600 ( t mobile ) is the true ' world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 )",1,1944
"not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at 5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity",1,1692

i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly,1,1800
i like the size and weight of this little critter,1,1970

overall an excellent phone,1,94
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it,1,1972
"it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ?",1,1914
"it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it ' s possible that i ' m missing something",1,3342
"if you ' ll only read the whole manual , you ' ll find out even more cool features and you ' ll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading",1,606
"at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in then there is no smell at all !",1,12

this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has,1,800

getting files onto it is quick and painless,1,1460

the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering,1,1954
1 ) the champ is easy to use,1,928
"further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod",1,3329
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line,1,602

the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use,1,812
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat,1,472

1 ) price gb of storage,1,1714
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone,1,2617
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration,1,3384
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version !,0,389
i will also say that it takes a very long moment for the camera to do its digital image processing between the time you press the button and when the camera actually takes the picture,0,1147
i tried to contact apex to return it ( i missed the amazon return period ) and it took 3 months to get through to their customer service dept,0,2263
3 mediasource is an application with serious user interface flaws,0,2303
"at first i thought it is only a isolated incident , but i was proven wrong when the player would not read my alias dvds as well",0,1399

purchased the ad 2600 about a month ago and have had numerous problems with it,0,1645
the flywheel you use for most of the navigation was n ' t in tightly and it was uneven as far as the amount of pressure to make it engage,0,2111
"then my dvds would stop playing in the middle , or not even be read at all",0,1809
it ' s perfect for those who aren ' t planning on storing tons of music,0,1493
"yes , you may get a whiff of a smell when you flip the handle , but then it is gone",0,2393
"sometimes , various applications crash",0,577

"sure it had all the features , but when i tried to shoot a girl ' s basketball game it just wan ' t up to the task",0,1289
"2 ) the remote works , but then it does not work , and you are left standing there thinking you are doing something wrong",0,239
"this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see",0,887
"my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above",0,2149
"the only thing i would complain about the zen xtra is that the controls are n ' t as easy as the ipod ' s , or as sexy looking",0,373
what is added in functionality ( battery replacement ) detracts in build quality as the face plate is prone to popping off,0,2109
the adobe software also was wonderful in 98 but it will not let you print correctly with xp so you are forced to create your document then either print it from windows or export it to another application,0,463
"the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf it doesn ' t work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars",0,2215
it took several days of attempts before things finally worked again and i have n ' t a clue why,0,619

the player itself has all sorts of problems,0,711
the only thing i don ' t like is the small size ( 8 meg ) memory card that comes with it,0,751
it sometimes takes the picture at some indefinite period of time after you press the shutter button,0,1807
